# A Blockchain based solution for Managing Transplant Waiting Lists and Medical Records 

Nowadays, the medical domain is suffering of lack of transparency, security and immutability. Developing a decentralized application based on blockchain technology can be helpful in achieving the requirements that will solve the identified problems. This paper proposes a blockchain based solution for managing the waiting list for a transplant as well as a solution for sharing medical records between parties. Sharing medical records between patients and doctors represents a sensitive process since it must be secured, and it addresses a challenging requirement in terms of storage scalability which is approached by using a distributed file system. Results show that our solution allows the waiting list to be more trustful and increases the patientsâ€™ chances for receiving the transplant and in the same time assures the ownership of the medical records, reducing the chances of attacks for stealing medical data.
